    <h2>Computer Science Major</h2>
    <p>Hello. My name is Mark Cuizon.</p>
    <p>Other than studying, I like diving into virtual reality and I'm learning how to DJ.</p>
    <p>I'm not married but I am a brother and a son of a first-generation Filipino family.</p>
    <p>I hope to get into a proactive job in ushering the new age of virtual reality computing.</p>
    <p>The thing I love the most about BYU-Idaho are the large amount of resources to help students succeed. There's a library that goes up until 11 PM on weekdays. There is a strong sense of community here.</p>
    <p>I am taking this course as a requirement for my major but I do strongly feel that having a solid foundation in web development is a good skill to have as a computer scientist.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church since birth. The quote I always fall back to without fail is James 1:5</p>
    <p>"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."</p>
